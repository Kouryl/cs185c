In this model experiment, I will investigate how season changes in fresh water discharge affect stratification, mixing, and circulation in the gulf of Alaska. The primary focus is to examine the variations in freshwater volume and how it influences halocline and the interaction between fresh water and sea water. To explore this question, I will construct a model that spans the gulf of Alaska, and simulate the dynamics of the gulf, capturing seasonal shifts in salinity, temperature, and density at different depths. I anticipate that the summer season will strengthen stratification in the gulf of Alaska.  For the initial conditions, I will probably use a 2008 ECCO version 5 model. I will then use a time series analysis to analyze the results, and then create a visualization with a movie about the salinity, density, or temperature changes.
